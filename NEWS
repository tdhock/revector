TODO

str_match_each_list returning a list instead of a string matrix, when
there are different numbers of capturing groups in each pattern.

Bug: current implementation will not work for subjects with some
unmatched groups. From the PCRE manual: 'It is possible for capturing
subpattern number n+1 to match some part of the subject when
subpattern n has not been used at all. For example, if the string
"abc" is matched against the pattern (a|(z))(bc) the return from the
function is 4, and subpatterns 1 and 3 are matched, but 2 is not. When
this happens, both values in the offset pairs corresponding to unused
subpatterns are set to -1. Offset values that correspond to unused
subpatterns at the end of the expression are also set to -1. For
example, if the string "abc" is matched against the pattern
(abc)(x(yz)?)? subpatterns 2 and 3 are not matched. The return from
the function is 2, because the highest used capturing subpattern
number is 1, and the offsets for for the second and third capturing
subpatterns (assuming the vector is large enough, of course) are set
to -1.'
